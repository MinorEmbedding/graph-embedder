# graph-embedder
[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/majorminer/badge/?version=latest)](https://majorminer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)


Testing a bunch of graph minor embedding heuristics and related techniques to improve the embedding of QUBOs.

Our final results for the project can be found [here](doc/Studienarbeit.pdf).



| :warning:    | This is a research repo, so APIs and algorithms might change frequently as we are trying out different ideas. Moreover, this means that the code is not production-ready. |
|---------------|:------------------------|

| :point_up:    | We currently do not implement the same approaches in C++ and Python, but try out different ideas in different programming languages. Make sure to check out both the C++ and Python implementation. |
|---------------|:------------------------|

# Python
All Python-related code and documentation can be found [in the Python folder](python/).

# C++
## Build C++ library
Note that in order to build, you have to clone the submodules as well. That is,
if you have already cloned this repository, you should run ```git submodule update --init --recursive``` and find the submodules in ```external/```.
In the case, you are about to clone the repository, just run ```git clone --recursive https://github.com/MinorEmbedding/majorminer.git```.

In order to build, you must then run the following commands
```
bash prepare.sh
mkdir build
cd build/
cmake .. -DMAJORMINER_BUILD_TESTS=[ON|OFF] # depending on whether you want to run tests
make
```
